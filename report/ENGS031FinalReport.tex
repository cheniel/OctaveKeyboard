% Give a concise summary of the goals and results from your project.
\vspace{-1.5em}

The goal of this project was to create a simple one­ octave keyboard mapped to buttons with the additional capability to autoplay ``Kids'' by MGMT when a switch is turned on. When the buttons corresponding to notes are pressed, the appropriate notes are played through the speaker, and LEDs which correspond to the keys light up. The LEDs can be disabled using a switch. 

This project was created by Vivian Hu and Daniel Chen in Summer 2014 at Dartmouth College for the Digital Electronics (ENGS031/COSC056) course. This report goes over the implementation, design, and usage of the final product, which implements all of these features.

\section{Introduction: The Problem} % State the problem to be solved.

  The problem that this project solves is the creation of a one-octave keyboard, and the ability to produce certain sounds through circuit logic. An additional issue is representing the song that will be autoplayed.

\section{Design Solution}

  \subsection{Specifications}
  
    % Specifications: Describe what your circuit does. This section will be similar to the project proposal. List any inputs such as buttons, keypads, sensors, etc., and any outputs such as displays, LEDs, actuators, etc. Include a block diagram of your circuit as well as a diagram of the control panel, showing the locations of buttons, displays, lights, etc., relative to each other. 

    \begin{multicols}{2}
      The inputs to this circuit are:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item 8 Buttons that map to the notes to play (bottom right of image to the right).
        \item An LED disable switch which disables LED output.
        \item An AutoPlay switch which enables the playing of ``Kids'' by MGMT.
      \end{itemize}

      The outputs to the circuit are:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item 8 LEDs which correspond to the notes being played.
        \item A speaker which outputs the notes appropriate to the song or specified by the keys.
      \end{itemize}

    The picture shown below displays the datapath and control of the circuit. The controller (a finite state machine) takes in all of the inputs and outputs the LEDs. It emits a signal corresponding to the note that needs to be output (a copy of the LED output) which is the Phase Accumulator receives. The data from the Phase Accumulator transfers to the Sine LUT, which goes to the Pulse Width Modulator...

  \subsection{Operating Instructions}

    % Operating instructions: Provide any information needed to set up and run your circuit. This is the User’s Manual part of your report.

    \begin{description}
      \item[Set up Circuit] \hfill \\
        To set up the one-octave keyboard circuit, you will need:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Xilinx ISE Design Suite 14.4
          \item Digilent Adept
          \item The source code or the programming file
          \item 1 x Digilent NEXYS 3 Spartan 6 FPGA
          \item 2 x 4 button Digilent Button Module
          \item 1 x Digilent PmodBB
          \item 1 x Digilent PmodAMP2
          \item 1 x Speaker
        \end{itemize}

        Here are the steps to get the circuit running:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item (If no bit file) Open the project in Xilinx, generate the programming file.
          \item Plug in FPGA (NEXYS 3 Spartan 6) into computer.
          \item Insert Digilent Button Modules in the top of JA1 and the top of JB1 on the NEXYS 3.
          \item Insert the Digilent PmodBB into JD1.
          \item Insert the PmodAMP2 into the top of J4 on the PmodBB. 
          \item Connect the speaker to J2 on PmodAMP2.
          \item Set up the RC circuit on the PmodBB.
          \item Open Digilent Adept, select bit file to program the FPGA.
        \end{enumerate}

      \item[Playing notes] \hfill \\
        To play notes, press the buttons on the FPGA corresponding to the notes that you want to play. There are two rows of four buttons. The top four buttons represent low c, d, e and f, while the bottom four buttons are g, a, b and high c.

        Only one note can be played at a time (first note pressed takes priority), and user-inputted notes only play when the auto-play switch is off.

      \item[Auto-play ``Kids'' by MGMT] \hfill \\
        To play ``Kids'' by MGMT, simply flip the AutoPlay switch on. You cannot create additional notes at this time using the buttons.

      \item[Disable LEDs] \hfill \\
        To disable the LEDs that light up corresponding to the notes that are pressed, simply turn on the LED disable switch.
        
    \end{description}

  \subsection{Theory of Operation}
  
    % Theory of operation: Discuss in detail how your circuit works. Start with a high-level overview of your design, illustrated by the block diagram. Give a prose description of each of the blocks and the interfaces between them. Describe what each block does and how it works. Make sure you discuss any tricks or functions that are not obvious from the logic diagram (e.g., ROMs used as lookup tables). From the information given in this section (with references to additional diagrams in the appendices), we should be able to reconstruct your design.

    The key component of our keyboard project is the geneneration of sine waves of varying frequencies using a technique called direct digital synthesis (DDS). To implement this, we use a combination of a phase accumulator and a sine wave lookup table (LUT) to produce wave samples of specific frequencies. In the place of a digital-to-analog converter, we use a pulse width modulator (PWM) to convert these sine wave samples to audio.

    The controller of our program is a finite state machine. The controller takes in the user's input and turns it into a single-note output for the Phase Accumulator and the LEDs. It uses the note that was input first. If two notes are both initially pressed at the same exact time, the lower note is used. When the autoplay switch gets turned on, the state machine moves into hard-coded states that play MGMT's ``Kids.'' The song only starts if the user is not currently pressing a key. The song consists of a large number of states that output a time that corresponds to the length of the note or the rest, and waits for either the switch to be turned off (at which point it goes to idle) or for the beat counter to reach it's max (at which point it moves to the next note or rest).

    The song itself consists of 3 snippets, which repeat in a particular fashion. Given that the three parts are A, B, and C, the song is a repetition of ACACBCBC. To keep track of this, an additional counter is used to determine whether to go to A or B at the end of C.See the appendix for detailed state diagrams related to the controller.
    
    8 different buttons (button module extensions on the FPGA), or ``key'' serve as the main ``playable'' interface of the keyboard. In VHDL, the keys are represented as an 8-bit bus input to the controller, where each bit represents a different note. Because our keyboard is monophonic, the controller checks each bit in succession from low to high C and outputs the first note it detects to the FreqLUT. As a result, only one bit in the 8-bit key\textunderscore out vector received by ToneFreq-LUT should be high at a time; otherwise, when no button is being pressed, all bits are `0'. This prevents conflicts when multiple buttons are pressed at once. The controller also takes in an LED\textunderscore disable input that disables the LEDs and a song\textunderscore enable that automatically plays back a pre-programmed song (here ``Kids'' by MGMT).

    Key\textunderscore out is then used as an index of sorts into the ToneFreq-LUT, which contains the pre-calculated phase increment values for each note, which is related to the desired frequency in the following way
        %equation increment = fdesired * 2^N/fclk
    where N represents the bit size of the accumulator and fclk is the frequency of the clock. We use N=13 here. This increment value is then passed on to the phase accumulator.

    The phase accumulator is essentially an incrementer composed of an adder and a register which increases by the increment value every clock cycle. However, although the system is running at a frequency of about 50MHz in order to reduce noise, in actuality the phase accumulator is updating at a frequency of around 10kHz, at the clk10 signal given by the PWMCounter. As a result, clk10 here serves as an enable. The phase produced by the accumulator is then passed as an input address to the SineLUT. However, because our SineLUT only takes an 8-bit phase, only the 8 most significant bits are used.

    To obtain wave samples, this value is then used as an index into a SineLUT supplied by the Xilinx Core Generator. Rather than having to generate all the samples of a waveform everytime, the values of a $2^M$ (where M is the bit size of our phase) sample wave are simply stored in block memory (BRAM) for easy access. The SineLUT generates a 10-bit sample for conversion by the PWM.

    The PWM maps the amplitude of the signal to a square wave pulse by comparing the sample value (which needs to be first converted from two's complement to unsigned offset binary) to a counter value. When the count is less than the sample, the comparator output is a `1'; otherwise the output is a `0'. In order to send the clk10 enable to the phase accumulator at a 10kHz frequency, the PWM counter also generates a terminal count signal every 5,000 clock cycles. 

    The signal then passes through an off-board low-pass RC filter that reduces higher frequency signal noise before passing the tone through to the speaker. One importnat thing to note is that the Pmod we used had a `shutdown' signal that had to be tied high in order to output sound.

    Our circuit also features the additional functionality of automatically playing a pre-programed song when given the song\textunderscore enable signal. Most of this work is done by the controller state-machine (ie which note or sequence to go to next). However, in order to get the song to play at an appropriate speed, we implemented an additional BeatCounter that counts at a rate of about 240 beats per minute. When the signal to autoplay the song is given, the controller sends a count\textunderscore en signal and a number count\textunderscore to to the beat counter letting it know how long to ``hold'' the note before sending the terminal tc\textunderscore tick back to the controller to move on to the next note/state.

  \subsection{Construction and Debugging}

    % Construction and debugging: Describe how you built and debugged your circuit. Which components did you build first? How did you test them? What problems did you have?

    To build the circuit, we began by building and testing the VHDL modules for the PWM. We designed the counter and the comparator and simulated the generation of wave ``samples'' with a seperate counter in the place of our DDS module. In our testbench, we were able to observe the square wave pulses getting wider as the ``sample'' increased as expected. From there, we implemented the phase accumulator. Testing was simply a matter of assigning an arbitrary number to the increment signal and confirming the values were adding up correctly. The next step was designing a lookup table with phase increment information for each note frequency and mapping it via the top module to the phase accumulator. We did run into a slight problem here with integer arithmetic. When trying to calculate the increment (as in equation above), dividing the desired frequency by the clock frequency first would always yield 0. To account for this, we simply multiplied the desired frequency by the phase constant ($2^N$) before dividing that product by the clock frequency.

    Once the main components were built and mapped together, we implemented the FSM controller, which handled the key and led outputs. From there, using a PmodBB (breadboard), we built a small low-pass RC filter; we ran into a little bit of wiring trouble because we weren't properly wired to ground, but it was pretty easily fixed. We then passed our tone through the RC filter and were able to display our sine waveforms on the oscilloscope. Our signal was definitely a sine wave, but we discovered that our desired frequencies were a power of 10 too large. It turned out this was because we had been testbenching our programs on a 10MHz clock, even though the FPGA was running at 100MHz. Adding a clock divider and clock buffer fixed this issue. After this, we were able to generate tones at the desired frequency, but we were getting a lot of residual high frequency noise. To counter this, we upped our system clock to 50MHz from 10MHz for a higher carrier frequency. This way, even though our PWMCounter was still only sending enable signals to the phase accumulator at 10kHz, the counter itself was running at 50MHz. Adding a larger capacitor helped to significantly reduce the noise, but also the volume of the keybaord itself. Although the noise is barely perceptable now, you can still hear it slightly.

    We also ran into a bug where the keyboard would be playing normally and then suddenly everything would stop. We figured some kind of metastability was occuring because we were using switches as ``keys''. We noticed that the keyboard would usually stop when we held a switch between `0' and `1'. After switching over to buttons, the problem was still occurring, but we remembered that we had forgotten to add debouncers to our buttons. This resolved our issue. 

    At the very end, once our keyboard was completely playable, we decided to go back in and implement the autoplay functionality. Most of that was done by simply adding more states to the controller. The only extra component we needed was a ``metronome'' of sorts in the form of our BeatCounter, which counted at a rate of 4 beats per second, or 240 beats per minute. Testbenching the counter was difficult because it took the simulator so long to generate a couple standard seconds as opposed to the usual nano- or micro- seconds, but we were able to observe terminal count ticks occurring at the right time. The major issue we ran into was that the first note of the song would sometimes be cut short or get dragged out. We resolved this by adding another ``idle''-like state that only occured when the song_enable went from low to high.

\section{Conclusions and Recommendations}

  % Conclusions: Summarize the goals and accomplishments of your project. Give a comparison of your original proposal (and final specifications) and the degree to which you achieved your proposed objectives. What recommendations do you have for future groups considering such a project? What words of general advice would you give to future groups?

  The original goal of our project was to simply make a one-octave keyboard that plays all the notes in C major. LEDs would light up when notes were played, unless an ``LED disable'' switch was turned on.

  At the end, we were not only able to accomplish our original goal of the simple keyboard but also to add an additional autoplay feature that played ``Kids'' by MGMT.

  For future groups looking to create this project, we would recommend that they really take the time to understand the operation of the circuit before jumping into the project. Another important consideration is to remember to synchronize the inputs and debounce the buttons throughout the project's creation.

    \subsubsection{Block Diagram}
	    % A functional block diagram which gives an overview of the hardware functional modules. By looking at this diagram, anyone else who has had the course should be able to understand what your project does. It is not necessary to use a drawing program to create your block diagram. A piece of graph paper and a ruler work just fine.

	    % Each block, each input / output port in a block, and each net connecting blocks should be labeled with a descriptive name. Input ports for a drawing are always at the left edge of the drawing, and output ports are at the right edge. Additionally, ports that connect to/from Pmods or the FX2 breadboard must be labeled with a connector and pin number, e.g., JA-2 for pin 2 of the JA Pmod connector.
	    % Here is a suggested hierarchy for your block diagrams:
	    %   (1) The top level that shows the main functional blocks, including switches, displays, etc. At this level, the logic in your FPGA can be one big “black box” with ports labeled to match the port declarations in the top level of your logic design (whether VHDL or schematic).
	    %   (2) The top level of logic in your FPGA. It’s simple to base your drawing on the RTL schematic generated by the Xilinx tool. If necessary, annotate it by hand so the reader can easily see what each block does.
      	%   (3) Work down “recursively” into each block. Make sure your drawings are labeled in such a way that their place in the hierarchy is clear.

    \subsubsection{Schematic Diagram}
      % A schematic diagram with signal names and pin numbers for any off-board circuitry that you designed and built (i.e., on the FX2 board). The purpose of this diagram is to show how your project is wired up and to help in debugging if it doesn’t work. Make sure you include detailed schematic diagrams for any special circuits (e.g. LED arrays). Each package should be given a unique identifier, known as the reference designator: Un for integrated circuits (where n = 1, 2, ...), Rn for resistors, Cn for capacitors, Qn for transistors, Sn for switches, Pn and Jn for plugs and jacks, respectively, Dn for diodes. LEDn is sometimes used for LEDs or arrays of LEDs (like 7- segment displays). If you have other parts, ask me.% 

    \newpage
    \subsubsection{Package Map}
      % A package map showing where each component is located on your board. This only applies to off-board circuits that you built. The package map should resemble an "aerial photograph" showing clearly all connectors (labeled Jn or Pn), sockets, ICs (Un), switches (Sn), displays, etc. The package map is used as an intermediate stage between the logic diagram and your circuit.

    	% Suppose you are troubleshooting your project. By studying the symptoms and your logic diagram, you deduce that there may be a wiring error at a particular part, e.g., a keypad encoder. On the logic diagram, that chip is labeled U8. You find U8 on the package map and it shows you precisely where to look on your circuit board to find the suspicious part. An easy way to create a package map is to annotate a digital photo of the board.

The first, ``User Play State Diagram,'' represents the state machine for when the user is given input through the buttons. The second, ``Autoplay State Diagram,'' represents the state machine when the autoplay mode is on. Both state diagrams share an idle state. If the song enable switch if off, the ``User Play State Diagram'' should be used. If it is turned on, the ``Autoplay State Diagram'' should be used.

	    		The program starts at the idle state in the ``User Play State Diagram.'' If the song enable switch is turned on, the state jumps to autoidle in the ``Autoplay State Diagram.'' Otherwise, the state changes depending on the user's input.
